Dates and Time: Monday and Tuesday, May 7th and 8th, 2018, 9:00am–4:30pm MST

Location: University of Arizona (exact room depends on number of participants)

Please [register and tell us what analysis/data you will bring](https://goo.gl/forms/UaAM4qjJC8fBuUqI3).

## Scope

Container technologies such as Docker and Singularity are letting scientists easily share, reuse, and scale all types of computational analyses.  The *CyVerse AstroContainers Workshop* is a two-day hands-on workshop designed for astronomers to learn how to create, use, and deploy containers across a variety of compute systems (your computer, CyVerse, local HPC, etc).  We will use blend of practical theory and hands-on exercises where small groups deploy tools and workflows they bring to the workshop.

## Target Audience/Participants

The workshop is designed for, but not limited to, astronomers and astrophysicists in Steward, LSST, NOAO, and LPL.  The examples of the workshop are astro-focused but the skill set is generic and applicable to many scientific analysis.

## Outcomes

- Theory and application of container technology
- How to use containerized software developed by other people
- How to containerize software
- How to build/deploy containerized workflows
- How to run your computation on local resources such as CyVerse and UA HPC

## BYOD/BYOA

**B**ring **Y**our **O**wn **D**ata and **A**nalyses.  Workshop participants are encouraged to bring their own data and analytical workflows for containerization.

## Required Experience:

- Linux command line, directory structures, shell commands
- Using and running analysis tools from the command line
- Experience using HPC, distributed computing, cloud computing systems
- Familiarity of logging into and using remote systems
- Basic programming experience (language of your choice)
