## Scope

Container technologies such as Docker and Singularity are letting scientists easily share, reuse, and scale all types of computational analyses.  The *CyVerse AstroContainers Workshop* is a two-day hands-on workshop designed for astronomers to learn how to create, use, and deploy containers across a variety of compute systems (your computer, CyVerse, local HPC, etc).  We will use blend of practical theory and hands-on exercises where small groups deploy tools and workflows they bring to the workshop.
